# Dashboard Attendance Fix

## Problem
The dashboard was still showing inconsistent attendance numbers compared to the member profile and events page, even after implementing the unified attendance service.

## Root Cause
The dashboard was using the `useAttendanceStats` hook which was doing its own date range filtering AND calling the unified service with `useLast30Days: true`. This caused double filtering:

1. `useAttendanceStats` was filtering events by a 30-day date range
2. The unified service was also filtering by 30 days
3. This created inconsistent results compared to other pages

## Solution
Replaced the complex `useAttendanceStats` hook with direct calls to the unified attendance service, ensuring all pages use the same logic.

## Changes Made

### **Dashboard Page** (`frontend/src/pages/dashboard.jsx`)

**Removed**:
- `useAttendanceStats` import and usage
- `attendanceDateRange` calculation
- Complex date range filtering logic

**Added**:
- Direct calls to `unifiedAttendanceService.getTopAttendees()` with `useLast30Days: true`
- Direct calls to `unifiedAttendanceService.getAttendanceDataForRange()` for detailed data
- Simple state management for attendance data
- Data transformation to match expected format

**Before**:
```javascript
const { isLoading: attendanceLoading, serviceBreakdown, memberStats, dailyData, eventDetails, error, clearCache: clearAttendanceCache } = useAttendanceStats(
  attendanceDateRange.startDate, 
  attendanceDateRange.endDate
);
```

**After**:
```javascript
const loadAttendanceData = useCallback(async () => {
  const { unifiedAttendanceService } = await import('../lib/unifiedAttendanceService');
  
  // Get top attendees using the same 30-day window as other pages
  const topAttendees = await unifiedAttendanceService.getTopAttendees({
    limit: 10,
    useLast30Days: true,
    includeFutureEvents: false,
    includeDeclined: false
  });
  
  // Get detailed attendance data
  const attendanceRangeData = await unifiedAttendanceService.getAttendanceDataForRange(
    thirtyDaysAgo.toISOString().split('T')[0],
    now.toISOString().split('T')[0],
    {
      includeFutureEvents: false,
      includeDeclined: false
    }
  );
  
  // Transform and set data...
}, []);
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All three pages now use the exact same unified service logic
2. **Simplicity**: Removed complex double-filtering logic
3. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for attendance calculations
4. **Performance**: Direct service calls instead of complex hook logic

## Expected Results

Now all three pages should show **identical attendance numbers** for Anthony Grose (and all members):

- **Member Profile**: X events (unified service with `useLast30Days: true`)
- **Dashboard**: X events (unified service with `useLast30Days: true`)
- **Events Page**: X events (unified service with `useLast30Days: true`)

## Files Modified

1. **`frontend/src/pages/dashboard.jsx`**
   - Removed `useAttendanceStats` import and usage
   - Added direct unified service calls
   - Simplified attendance data loading logic
   - Updated cache clearing mechanism

## Testing

The dashboard should now show the same attendance numbers as the member profile and events page. All three pages use:
- Same 30-day window calculation
- Same unified service methods
- Same filtering logic (`includeFutureEvents: false`, `includeDeclined: false`)
- Same event type categorization

This ensures complete consistency across the application.
