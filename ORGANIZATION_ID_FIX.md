# Event Attendance Organization ID Fix

## Problem Identified
You discovered that there are `event_attendance` records with missing `organization_id` values. This is a critical issue that can cause:

1. **Data Inconsistency**: Records from different organizations mixing together
2. **Security Issues**: Users potentially seeing data from other organizations
3. **Incorrect Attendance Counts**: Unified service filtering may exclude or include wrong records
4. **Performance Issues**: Queries may return unexpected results

## Root Cause
The `event_attendance` table was created in early migrations without an `organization_id` column. Later migrations added the column, but existing records were not updated with the correct organization_id values.

## Migration History Analysis
Looking at the migration files:

1. **Early migrations** (20240321, 20240320): Created `event_attendance` without `organization_id`
2. **Later migration** (20250101): Added `organization_id` column to existing tables
3. **Fix script** (fix_events_organization.sql): Attempted to update organization_id but may have missed some records

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Database Fix Script
Created `fix_event_attendance_organization.sql` to:
- Identify records missing `organization_id`
- Update records using organization_id from related `events` table
- Update records using organization_id from related `members` table
- Set default organization_id for any remaining records
- Verify the fix with counts and sample data

### 2. Unified Service Consistency
Updated `unifiedAttendanceService.js` to ensure all methods filter by organization:

**Before**:
```javascript
// getMemberAttendanceCount - NO organization filtering
let query = supabase
  .from('event_attendance')
  .select(`*, events (...)`)
  .eq('member_id', memberId);
```

**After**:
```javascript
// getMemberAttendanceCount - WITH organization filtering
const organizationId = await getCurrentUserOrganizationId();
let query = supabase
  .from('event_attendance')
  .select(`*, events!inner(...)`)
  .eq('member_id', memberId)
  .eq('events.organization_id', organizationId);
```

### 3. Methods Now Consistently Filtered
All unified service methods now properly filter by organization:
- ✅ `getMemberAttendanceCount()` - Added organization filtering
- ✅ `getTopAttendees()` - Already had organization filtering
- ✅ `getAttendanceDataForRange()` - Already had organization filtering
- ✅ `getDashboardAttendanceStats()` - Already had organization filtering

## SQL Fix Script Details

The `fix_event_attendance_organization.sql` script:

1. **Diagnostics**: Counts records missing organization_id
2. **Primary Fix**: Updates from `events.organization_id`
3. **Secondary Fix**: Updates from `members.organization_id` (for orphaned records)
4. **Fallback**: Sets default organization_id for any remaining records
5. **Verification**: Shows before/after counts and sample data

## Expected Results

After running the fix script:

1. **All event_attendance records will have organization_id**
2. **Consistent attendance counts across all pages**
3. **Proper data isolation between organizations**
4. **Improved query performance**

## Files Modified

1. **`fix_event_attendance_organization.sql`** - Database fix script
2. **`frontend/src/lib/unifiedAttendanceService.js`** - Added organization filtering to `getMemberAttendanceCount`

## Next Steps

1. **Run the SQL fix script** in your database
2. **Verify the results** using the diagnostic queries in the script
3. **Test the application** to ensure attendance counts are now consistent
4. **Monitor for any remaining issues**

## Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future:
- Always include `organization_id` in new records
- Add database constraints to require `organization_id`
- Implement data validation in the application layer
- Regular audits of data consistency

This fix should resolve the attendance inconsistency issues you were experiencing across the member profile, dashboard, and events pages.
