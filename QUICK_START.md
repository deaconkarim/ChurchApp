## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Start Docker Desktop
Make sure Docker Desktop is running on your machine.

4. Enter your email and password
5. Copy the **User ID** (you'll need this)

### 4. Link User to Organization
1. Go to **SQL Editor** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Run this query (replace `YOUR_USER_ID` with the actual user ID):

```sql
INSERT INTO public.organization_users (
    organization_id,
    user_id,
    role,
    status
) VALUES (
    '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000',
    'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE',
    'owner',
    'active'
);
```

### 5. Start the App
```bash
npm run dev
```
