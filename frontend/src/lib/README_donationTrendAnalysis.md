# Donation Trend Analysis

## Overview

The donation trend analysis provides sophisticated weekly pattern analysis for church donations, accounting for the natural ebb and flow of giving throughout the month.

## Key Features

### üóìÔ∏è Weekly Pattern Recognition
- Analyzes donations by week of the month (1-5 weeks)
- Compares current week to the same week in previous months
- Accounts for typical giving patterns (higher at month start)

### üìä Multiple Comparison Methods
1. **Last Month Comparison**: Current week vs same week last month
2. **3-Month Average**: Current week vs average of same week across last 3 months

### üéØ Context-Aware Analysis
- Week 1: "First week of month (typically highest giving)"
- Week 2: "Second week of month"
- Week 3: "Third week of month"
- Week 4: "Fourth week of month"
- Week 5+: "Final week of month"
